## User Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Alex, dedicated corporate worker, 31 years old
Alex wakes up early, groggy but knowing he needs to check the weather before heading out. He grabs his phone and opens Breeze, which immediately shows the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed based on his location. Scrolling down, he notices rain is expected in the afternoon. He sighs, grabs an umbrella, and checks the hourly forecast to see exactly when the rain will start.
Since itâ€™s Wednesday, he also takes a quick peek at the weekend forecastâ€”perfect weather for a hiking trip heâ€™s been planning. Smiling, he adds a reminder to his calendar and saves his office location in the app to keep track of the weather during his commute. With everything set, he heads out, feeling prepared for the day ahead.

### Scenario 2: Maria, travel enthusiast, 23 years old
Maria zips up her suitcase and sits down to do one final check before heading to the airport. Opening Breeze, she navigates to "Saved Locations" and quickly adds Paris, her destination. Within seconds, a detailed five-day forecast appears, showing temperatures much colder than back home. She frowns, realizing she needs to pack a heavier jacket and an umbrella.
As her flight takes off, Maria keeps an eye on both her hometown and Paris, switching between the two locations with ease. Later that evening, while sipping coffee at her hotel, she notices that severe weather is expected in Paris tomorrow. She enters the app, sees a storm warning, and decides to adjust her plans. Thanks to Breeze, sheâ€™s one step ahead of the unpredictable weather.

### Scenario 3: Daniel, cycling amateur, 46 years old
Daniel straps on his cycling helmet, ready to hit the road for a long ride through the countryside. The sky is clear, but he knows the weather can change quickly. He pulls up Breeze and checks the forecast for his route. Everything looks good, though thereâ€™s a slight risk of thunderstorms in the evening.  A few hours into his ride, while on a break, he checks his phone â€”a storm warning for his exact location. Heart racing, he quickly opens the radar map and sees dark clouds approaching fast. Without hesitation, he reroutes to the nearest shelter just as heavy rain starts to fall. As he watches the storm from a cafÃ© window, he feels relieved. Without Breezeâ€™s real-time updates, he wouldâ€™ve been caught miles from safety.

# Architectural report
Overall, the app ended up similar to what we envisioned at the halfway point in this project, but unfortunately the result is less complex than what we wanted when we started. Breeze successfully delivers accurate and real-time weather updates with a robust and scalable architecture. Built with Angular for the frontend and .NET for the backend, the application ensures smooth performance and a modern user experience. Through rigorous testing, security measures, and a well-defined CI/CD pipeline, the application meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

## Non-functional requirements

## Security Analysis
### Security Risks
- One of the key security risks identified is API key exposure, which could allow unauthorized access to the weather API and lead to data breaches or misuse.

- Another risk is that of a SQL injection, a critical security risk where attackers can manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.

- Another risk is potential data leakage, where sensitive user preferences could be exposed due to improper handling or storage of user data.


### Security Measures
- To mitigate the risk of API key exposure, all API keys are securely stored in environment variables, ensuring they are never exposed in frontend code or accessible to unauthorized parties.

- All sensitive data, including user information, are encrypted, ensuring that data cannot be easily intercepted or accessed by unauthorized individuals.

- We used Entity Framework, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET that simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with data as objects, rather than writing raw SQL queries. It enhances security by preventing SQL injection through parameterized queries, automatically sanitizing user inputs. The framework also ensures data validation before it is persisted, preventing invalid or malicious data from being stored


## CI/CD 
We utilized GitHub for version control, enabling seamless collaboration and code management. All source code is stored in a centralized GitHub repository, allowing us to push changes, create branches, and submit pull requests for review. Once a pull request is approved, the code is merged into the main branch, which triggers deployment to the appropriate environment.  
Also, we used GitHub Actions to set up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build and testing process for our project. The pipeline is triggered on every push and pull request to the main branch, ensuring that new code is always validated before being merged.

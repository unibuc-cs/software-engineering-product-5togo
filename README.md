## User Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Alex, dedicated corporate worker, 31 years old
Alex wakes up early, groggy but knowing he needs to check the weather before heading out. He grabs his phone and opens Breeze, which immediately shows the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed based on his location. Scrolling down, he notices rain is expected in the afternoon. He sighs, grabs an umbrella, and checks the hourly forecast to see exactly when the rain will start.
Since itâ€™s Wednesday, he also takes a quick peek at the weekend forecastâ€”perfect weather for a hiking trip heâ€™s been planning. Smiling, he adds a reminder to his calendar and saves his office location in the app to keep track of the weather during his commute. With everything set, he heads out, feeling prepared for the day ahead.

### Scenario 2: Maria, travel enthusiast, 23 years old
Maria zips up her suitcase and sits down to do one final check before heading to the airport. Opening Breeze, she navigates to "Saved Locations" and quickly adds Paris, her destination. Within seconds, a detailed five-day forecast appears, showing temperatures much colder than back home. She frowns, realizing she needs to pack a heavier jacket and an umbrella.
As her flight takes off, Maria keeps an eye on both her hometown and Paris, switching between the two locations with ease. Later that evening, while sipping coffee at her hotel, she notices that severe weather is expected in Paris tomorrow. She enters the app, sees a storm warning, and decides to adjust her plans. Thanks to Breeze, sheâ€™s one step ahead of the unpredictable weather.

### Scenario 3: Daniel, cycling amateur, 46 years old
Daniel straps on his cycling helmet, ready to hit the road for a long ride through the countryside. The sky is clear, but he knows the weather can change quickly. He pulls up Breeze and checks the forecast for his route. Everything looks good, though thereâ€™s a slight risk of thunderstorms in the evening.  A few hours into his ride, while on a break, he checks his phone â€”a storm warning for his exact location. Heart racing, he quickly opens the radar map and sees dark clouds approaching fast. Without hesitation, he reroutes to the nearest shelter just as heavy rain starts to fall. As he watches the storm from a cafÃ© window, he feels relieved. Without Breezeâ€™s real-time updates, he wouldâ€™ve been caught miles from safety.
